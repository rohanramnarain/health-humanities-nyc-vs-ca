This project uses **Jekyll**, **Liquid**, and a tiny data file to compare NYC and California on health-and-humanities topics.  
- No heavy JS frameworks  
- Markdown + YAML + HTML includes  
- Easy to host on **GitHub Pages**

**Next steps:** Replace placeholder text with sourced facts and links to libraries, archives, clinics, and public programs.
